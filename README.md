# 04-Web-APIs-Code-Quiz

## Description

This project is a quiz based on coding terminology

- My motivation for this project was to create something using my Web API Skills, and also creating something within the realm of coding itself.
- While creating this project I learned a lot of different things but mostly about how for loops work and how things are stored in local storage.

## Usage

To use this application, you must start the quiz by clicking the "Start Quiz" button.
Once the quiz begins you will be given a countdown from 100 seconds.
During this time you will answer the code related questions to the best of your ability.
If you incorrectly answer a question your time will be reduced by 10 seconds.
Once your quiz ends you will enter your initials and be taken to the high scvores list.
